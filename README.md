# Valiheim-Mod-Collection
This is the place where the prepared folder with all the mods for Valiheim 4.0 will live. 

## Installation Instructions

1. Download this repository via `Code > Download ZIP`
2. Extract all contents into a folder (outside of your valheim game directory!)
3. Copy all the contents inside the folder `BepInExPack_Valheim`
4. Paste them into your valheim game directory (likely located at someplace like `.../steamapps/common/Valheim`)
5. If your system notifies you of duplicate files, select **replace all**.

Done :), your local valheim game is now in sync with my server.
